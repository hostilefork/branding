# StackOverflow Ad

This advertisement was created as part of StackOverflow's Open-Source Recruiting campaign.  It was the second-highest voted ad by StackOverflow users, and was clicked on twice as much as any other ad during the period it ran (1st half of 2014):

*(Note: The counters were reset near the end of the period, there were about 10,000 clicks.)*

The ad was drawn to their rules, which were to be 220x250 and have at least a one-pixel non-white border if the background was principally white.


# License

The goal is to avoid ambiguity in terms of permission to use this ad to promote Red vs. granting permission to remix the ad and use the Red tower trademark.  So this is licensed as Creative Commons with no derivative works allowed, except by permission.

*(Note: That permission is probably very easy to get!  Just trying to be prudent about preventing unofficial Red builds getting in app stores, and charging money or installing spyware--trading on Red's trust.  If you're not at least somewhat careful with licensing of graphics, you may be writing a blank check for people to do such things, and be fully within their rights in doing so...)*
