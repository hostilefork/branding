# Red 3-D Tower Icon

The 3-D icon for Red is intended to represent its notion of a "Full Stack" language.  It alludes to the game "Towers of Hanoi", typically used to teach recursion in computer science classes:

The tower is in its initial (or final?) condition. While most towers of Hanoi are round and do not require careful placement, the Red tower uses square plates which are organized in an alignment representing more thoughts. This suits the idea of an orderly stacked system, as well as having roots in computer science education as an early exercise in recursion.

As a motif, it permits playfulness in a dynamic and "living" way. The logo can be physically built into a working game, and can be animated or contrasted with less orderly systems. One hope is that the default demos and test programs for Red would use this by being Towers-of-Hanoi related.

Initial concept by @HostileFork, with a more polished image prepared to present at Recode 2013 in Montreal by Peter Stefek (a.k.a. "phob"). Peter's drawing was subsequently adjusted to fit into a square aspect ratio.

Peter's drawing was sent as a PNG file and was not made using 3-D software. Thus the tower only exists as a PNG with a maximum dimension of 1280x1280 (including margins). It was not intended as the final packaged icon--but as a reference drawing from which platform-specific icons would be made; as the icon needs to be customized to match each platform it runs on.

For those platforms and sizes for which a 3D icon is not suitable or cannot be reduced to a small size and still be recognizable, please see the `/flat-icon` resources.
