# RED/SYSTEM ICON

The Red/System icon is a stylized hydrogen atom, in a red color.

As with the word for the color "red" it's not terribly unique to be using it, except in the context of programming language distributions. Inspiration for it came from places like Dr. Manhattan's forehead tattoo (in blue) from the Watchmen.

It's not particularly important to have a "brand" for Red/System separate from the Red language project.  However, the requirement for a symbol was driven by the need for a document icon for .REDS files. As there might be other purposes for it, it has been defined in the branding project. Also, this is the avatar Nenad Rakocevic uses to contribute to the Red Language repository.


## Proportionality

The rim of the atom is one unit in width. The center circle has a diameter of 5 units, while the circle on the top of the rim has a diameter of 2 units.
