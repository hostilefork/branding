The actual legalese governing graphics or promotional materials for 
Red and Red/System are laid out in the accompanying LICENSE files.
These are found in the directory alongside those materials.  

License terms vary based on what the material is.  But the biggest 
FAQ issue is this one:

                      !!! THIS IS IMPORTANT !!!

The Red and Red/System logos are trademarks of the Red Language Project 
(red-lang.org), which is Copyright (c) 2011, Nenad Rakocevic.

All rights are reserved in usage of these marks, *unless otherwise 
specifically granted*.  Those reserved rights apply to usage as software 
application icons, identifying graphics in web themes, marks on 
promotional real-world products, or any other purpose that is not 
specifically mentioned here. 

(Note: These terms should be familiar to anyone who has worked with
issues of branding with open source projects like Firefox or Chrome, 
or websites like GitHub.  Even the Creative Commons Project itself 
retains all rights on their logos for the licenses!)

                      ... BUT ON THE FUN SIDE ...

...it does say all rights are reserved *unless otherwise specifically
granted*.  Some specific usages are permitted for anyone without having
to make an individual request, and these are laid out in the "Logo
Usage Rules".  But also feel free to get in touch to ask permission if 
you have a good idea for promoting Red, and think the rules are getting 
in the way!
